**Bayesian Network**


A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph in which each edge corresponds to a conditional dependency, and each node corresponds to a unique random variable.Bayesian network consists of two major parts: a directed acyclic graph and a set of conditional probability distributions.
The directed acyclic graph is a set of random variables represented by nodes.The conditional probability distribution of a node (random variable) is defined for every possible outcome of the preceding causal node(s).
For illustration, consider the following example. 
Suppose we attempt to turn on our computer, but the computer does not start (observation/evidence). We would like to know which of the possible causes of computer failure is more likely. In this simplified illustration, we assume only two possible causes of this misfortune: electricity failure and computer malfunction.

**Program Explanation**


Here, we import the required libraries. `numpy` and `pandas` are commonly used for data manipulation and analysis. `pgmpy` is a Python library for Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), and it provides tools for modeling Bayesian Networks and performing probabilistic inference.This code reads data from a CSV file named 'heart.csv' and stores it in a DataFrame called `heartDisease`. The data contains information related to heart disease, and any missing values represented by '?' are replaced with `NaN` using `np.nan`.Here, we define the structure of the Bayesian Network. The model represents the dependencies between different variables related to heart disease. For example, 'Age', 'Sex', 'ExAng', and 'ChestPain' are parents of 'AHD', which means they influence the presence of heart disease. Similarly, 'AHD' is the parent of 'RestECG' and 'Chol', indicating that 'AHD' influences these variables.The Bayesian Network model is fitted to the data using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). This process estimates the conditional probability distributions for each node in the network based on the observed data.An instance of the `VariableElimination` class is created with the fitted model. This allows us to perform inference, i.e., make predictions or query probabilities, based on the Bayesian Network.The code collects user inputs for two variables: 'RestECG' and 'ChestPain'. The user is prompted to enter the values for these variables. 'RestECG' is expected to be an integer (0, 1, or 2), and 'ChestPain' should be one of the specified strings.The code performs inference based on the user inputs. It queries the Bayesian Network to get the probability distribution of the 'AHD' variable (heart disease) given the provided evidence ('RestECG' and 'ChestPain' values).Finally, the code prints the probability distribution of heart disease ('AHD') given the provided evidence for 'RestECG' and 'ChestPain'. The result will show the probabilities of 'AHD' being True or False based on the given evidence.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to use a Bayesian Network to model heart disease data, fit the model using MLE, and perform probabilistic inference to predict the probability of heart disease based on user inputs for 'RestECG' and 'ChestPain'.
